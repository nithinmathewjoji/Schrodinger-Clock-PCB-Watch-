##  Firmware & Software

The firmware is written in **Arduino** using the ESP32 library. It supports:
- RTC time synchronization
- OLED display updates
- Battery monitoring
- Button interactions
- Alarm system with buzzer



---

##  Assembly & Soldering Guide

### Tools Required:
- Soldering iron with fine tip
- SMD soldering paste
- Hot air reflow station (optional)
- Multimeter for testing

### Assembly Steps:
1. Solder the **ESP32-S3-WROOM** module first.
2. Attach **RTC DS3231** and connect alarm pin to ESP32.
3. Solder **resistors, capacitors, and power circuits**.
4. Mount **OLED display** and ensure I2C connectivity.
5. Connect **battery and charging module**.
6. Flash firmware and test.

---

##  Usage Guide

### Powering On:
Press and hold the power button. The watch will display the **time, battery status**, and active alarms.

### Setting Time:
Use the **serial monitor** to set the time in RTC using `setTime()`.

### Battery Monitoring:
Battery percentage is displayed on-screen and can be accessed through the serial monitor.

### Alarm Function:
The RTC alarm triggers a buzzer sound at the set time.

##  Power Management

- **Automatic Power Switching:** P-MOSFET allows seamless switching between USB and battery.
- **USB Protection:** Schottky diode prevents reverse current flow.
- **Low Power Mode:** ESP32 enters deep sleep when inactive to conserve power.
