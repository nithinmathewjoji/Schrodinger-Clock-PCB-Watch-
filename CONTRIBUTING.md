# SchrÃ¶dinger Watch

## Overview
SchrÃ¶dinger Watch is an open-source PCB watch project powered by an ESP32-S3-WROOM module. The project is designed for DIY enthusiasts and embedded system developers who want to explore low-power wearable technology. The watch features an RTC, an OLED display, multiple push buttons, battery monitoring, and alarm functionalities.

## Features
- **ESP32-S3-WROOM (40-pin)** for processing and connectivity
- **RTC DS3231** with alarm functionality
- **I2C OLED display** for time and notifications
- **3.7V Li-Po battery** with **TP4056 charging module**
- **Push buttons, LEDs, buzzer** for user interaction
- **Micro-USB port** for charging and communication
- **Voltage divider for battery status detection**
- **P-MOSFET for automatic power switching**
- **Schottky diode for USB protection**

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/schrodinger-watch.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies (Arduino libraries, ESP32 board package, etc.).
3. Compile and upload firmware using Arduino IDE or PlatformIO.
4. Assemble the hardware components following the PCB layout.
5. Power up the watch and test its functionality.
